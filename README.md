# ScientificCalculator
This calculator should be able to read mathematical expressions and assignments, compute the result of the expressions and execute the assignments.

A mathematical expression can be made up of numbers, variables, mathematical operations, constants, mathematical functions, and parentheses. Some examples of mathematical expressions:

2.3+4*3–2  

(0.4+2)*(4–12.5)  

2^2+(4-3)^2*(1-3))

(count + 1) ^ (growth/10)

x^(0-y)^2

(((((1+2)+3)+4)+5)+6)

2* Pi *radius^2

4.5 – e ^ log(4.5)

sin(angle)^2 + cos(angle)^2

sin(2.4)

This program support using the following mathematical constants: Pi = 3.14169 and e = 2.718

This program support the use of the following mathematical functions in the expressions: sin, cos and log

If an assignment is made up of a variable and an expression and is used to store the result of the expression in the variable. The format of an assignment is let <variable-name> = <expression> and the given variable could be used in any expression after this assignment.

    let myVar = 4

    4 / myVar

Note that the names of the variables are case-sensitive, in other words, Count and count are two different variables and can have different values. The names quit,sin,cos,log,let,Pi, and e will not be used as variable names since they are reserved for constants, functions, to signal the termination of the program and to declare the variables.

All numbers are double-precision floating-point numbers.
